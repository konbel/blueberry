# Blueberry

A collection of utilities for C# Godot projects.

## Overview

Blueberry provides a set of utilities and tools to enhance your Godot development experience when using C#. This library focuses on providing robust, type-safe functionality that leverages C#'s advanced features.

## Requirements

- **Godot 4.x** with .NET support
- **C# / .NET**

## GDScript Support

**GDScript is not supported** as of the current release of Godot. This is because GDScript lacks several language features that are essential for this library's functionality, including:

- C# constructors with parameters
- Parameter overloading
- Other advanced type system features

## Features

### Noise Generation

Flexible noise generation system supporting 1D, 2D, and 3D noise with customizable settings and filters.
